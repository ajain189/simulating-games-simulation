# Screw Your Neighbor Simulation

This project simulates the card game "Screw Your Neighbor" (also known as Chase the Ace) to analyze game theory and optimal strategies. Developed for a J-Term class at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM).

### Capabilities
- **Strategy Analysis**: Uses Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the optimal hand value threshold for swapping cards.
- **Position Advantage**: Runs millions of iterations to determine if a player's seating position statistically impacts their win/loss rate.
- **Dealer Edge**: Quantifies the specific advantage or disadvantage held by the dealer.
- **Visualizations**: Automatically generates statistical graphs (`results/simulation_results.png`) to visualize loss rates and strategic thresholds.
